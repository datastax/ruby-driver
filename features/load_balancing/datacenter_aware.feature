Feature: Datacenter-aware Round Robin Policy

  A specialized Round Robin load balancing policy allows for querying remote
  datacenters only when all local nodes are down. This policy will round robin
  requests across hosts in the local datacenter, falling back to remote
  datacenter if necessary. The name of the local datacenter must be supplied by
  the user.

  All known remote hosts will be tried when local nodes are not available.
  However, you can configure the exact number of remote hosts that will be used
  by passing that number when constructing a policy instance.

  By default, this policy will not attempt to use remote hosts for local
  consistencies (`:local_one` or `:local_quorum`), however, it is possible to
  change that behavior via constructor.

  Background:
    Given a running cassandra cluster in 2 datacenters with 2 nodes in each
    And the following schema:
