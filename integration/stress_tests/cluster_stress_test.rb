  # Test for cluster connection leakage
  #
  # test_clusters_should_not_leak_connections tests for connection leaks in cluster objects, and is a port of JAVA-432.
  # It creates 10 clusters and verifies that 10 control connections are created. Then it creates 1 session for each
  # cluster and verifies that each session opens another 2 connections. It then closes the sessions and checks that only
  # the control connections are open. Finally, it closes the clusters and verifies that no open connections exist.
  # This entire process is repeated 500 times.
  #
  # @param param1 [Int] Number of clusters to launch.
  #
  # @raise [RuntimeError] If a session or cluster was unable to be created or destroyed.
  #
  # @since 1.0.0
  # @jira_ticket RUBY-60
  # @expected_result The connection counts should match the expected along the way, and there should be no open
  # connections at the end of the test.
