module Cassandra
  module TimestampGenerator
    # In JRuby, {::Time} has millisecond precision. We require client timestamps to have microsecond precision to
    # minimize clashes in C*. This generator keeps track of the last generated timestamp, and if the current-time
    # is within the same millisecond as the last, it fills the microsecond portion of the new timestamp with the
    # value of an incrementing counter.
    #
    # For example, if the generator triggers twice at time 12345678000 (microsecond granularity, but ms precisions
    # as shown by 0's for the three least-significant digits), it'll return 12345678000 and 12345678001.
