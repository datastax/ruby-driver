module Cassandra

    # An auth provider is a factory for {Cassandra::Auth::Authenticator authenticator}
    # instances (or objects matching that interface). Its {#create_authenticator} will
    # be called once for each connection that requires authentication.
    #
    # If the authentication requires keeping state, keep that in the
    # authenticator instances, not in the auth provider.
    #
    # @note Creating an authenticator must absolutely not block, or the whole
    #   connection process will block.
    #
    # @abstract Auth providers given to {Cassandra.cluster} don't need to be
    #   subclasses of this class, but need to implement the same methods. This
    #   class exists only for documentation purposes.
    #
    # @see Cassandra::Auth::Providers
    class Provider
      # @!method create_authenticator(authentication_class, host)
      #
      # Create a new authenticator object. This method will be called once per
      # connection that requires authentication. The auth provider can create
      # different authenticators for different authentication classes, or return
      # nil if it does not support the authentication class.
      #
      # @note This method must absolutely not block.
      #
      # @param authentication_class [String] the authentication class used by
      #   the server.
      # @param host [Cassandra::Host] the node to whom we're authenticating.
      #
      # @return [Cassandra::Auth::Authenticator, nil] an object with an
      #   interface matching {Cassandra::Auth::Authenticator} or `nil` if the
      #   authentication class is not supported.
    end

    # An authenticator handles the authentication challenge/response cycles of
    # a single connection. It can be stateful, but it must not for any reason
    # block. If any of the method calls block, the whole connection process
    # will be blocked.
